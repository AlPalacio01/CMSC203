/*
 * Class: CMSC203 32324
 * Instructor: Grigoriy Grinberg
 * Description: Build a Patient class, Procedure class, and PatientDriverApp class. The Patient 
 * class takes the patient’s information and details. The Procedure class represents the medical 
 * procedure that has been performed on a patient. The PatientDriverApp class creates an instance 
 * of the Patient class and initializes it with information. It also creates three instances of 
 * the Procedure class each using the different constructors.
 * Due: 02/23/2026
 * Platform/compiler: Eclipse
 * I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment 
* independently. I have not copied the code from a student or   * any source. I have not given my code to any student.
